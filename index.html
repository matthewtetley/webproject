            <p >Encryption is the method of sending files in a method in which the contents has ciphers added to it, that needs to be decrypted. There has been various types of encryption used sinced the first ciphers were created but now are currently 64bytes or 128bytes long and made up of different letters and numbers of different cases(upper or lower).</p>
            <p>
              Encryption started with the rise of ciphers in the beginning of world war 2 with Great Britain wanting to read Messages being transmitted by German forces to prevent attacks. The Most famous of these ciphers is the Enigma Cipher developed in 1932.
